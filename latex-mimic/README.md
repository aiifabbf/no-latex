# latex-mimic

This is a demo showing how the default LaTeX style can be implemented with web technologies, without pain.

You can download and install Latin Modern (which is the default font family for XeLaTeX) at [here](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download). The OTF version will work, giving your paper a very similar look as LaTeX.

Page layout numerics come from [wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Page_Layout).
